// Rebuild the lib before the e2e modules are imported.

// The e2e specs — and the managed-app harness they boot — import this package
// by name, which Node self-references through the `exports` map in
// package.json, so they exercise the published resolution contract and the
// compiled output must be current. This runs as a `setupFiles` entry: once per test
// file, *before* the test's top-level imports resolve, and again on every
// `--watch` save (unlike `pretest`/`globalSetup`, which fire once per jest
// process). `tsc --incremental` keeps it sub-second when nothing changed.
